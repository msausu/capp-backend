  - PessoaFÃ­sica/Customer CRUD (id, nome/name, CPF, dataNascimento/birthDate);
  - CRUD must have API GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH and PUT.
2. The GET API must accept "query strings" to search for customers by CPF and name;
3. Client response should be paged;
4. The customer has the age calculated considering the date of birth;
5. At the root of the project, there must be a Postman to assess the api.
